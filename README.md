# DSA-90inDays
So, It was _3 PM-midnight on 15/05/2022_ and I was frustrated with the questions of Discrete Structures that were given by ma'am which were all based upon DSA and she had taught us nothing except searching and sorting arrays XD. Then I finally decided to learn DSA after watching a DSA Roadmap video of Nishant Chahar and accepted his 90 days DSA challenge ( obviously I am not going to make it in 90 days XD but ), Thank you, man!

>## Day 1 - 16/05/22
1. Introduction to DSA
2. Time Complexity and Big O Notation
3. Asymptotic Notations ( Big O, Big Omega and Big Theta )
