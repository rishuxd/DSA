# DSA-90inDays
**Keep in mind “ Mnn bohot karega ki chor yrr apne se nahi hoga ya maza nahi aa rha, Just ask one question “ Why I started ? "** _to set a mark of rishuxd who will crack his dream companies just after completing his three years BSC CS course, also that money factor stands with me XD._

So, It was _3 PM-midnight on 15/05/2022_ and I was frustrated with the questions of Discrete Structures that were given by ma'am which were all based upon DSA and she had taught us nothing except searching and sorting arrays XD. Then I finally decided to learn DSA after watching a DSA Roadmap video of Nishant Chahar and accepted his 90 days DSA challenge ( obviously I am not going to make it in 90 days XD but ), Thank you, man!
